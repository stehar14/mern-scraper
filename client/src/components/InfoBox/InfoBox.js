          <p class="center light">The Sun News is the Grand Strand's local news leader. They are passionate about their responsibility as being Horry County's most compelling and trustworthy information source through their newspaper, other print products, and websites. While primarily a coastal tourism-based community, the region also contains rural, agricultural and some light industrial sections. The area's population is composed of a distinct mix of "native"-born locals and residents who have relocated to the area from all over the world. Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand area are considered one of the country's most visited family and golf vacation destinations.</p>
